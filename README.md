# [deprecated] A Question of Code: Gatsby build

Static site for the *A Question of Code* podcast: [aquestionofcode.com](https://aquestionofcode.com/)

Build using the Gatsby static site generator (so we can do fun React stuff and *still* only deliver flat HTML to visitors).

## Setup

Install dependencies with `npm install`

Start development environment with `gatsby develop`
