summary: "Can toxic habits be excused by coding-talent?"
---

In general, developers are awesome people. Both our hosts have been helped and supported by some fantastically friendly and generous engineers. But there are *some* bad eggs. And given that we spend a lot of our time online, the nasty folk can be more vocal and more visible. And to make matters worse, we often see the bad characteristics excused by high performance. "A bad person can be valuable to your company if they're really good at code" is often said. But is it logical? Is it helpful to examine the idea of the "developer savant" who is excellent with computers but toxic with real people? Why on earth would you want to be a 10× engineer, if being a 10× engineer means you have to be a sociopath?! Find out all this, and more, in this week's infuriating instalment of A Question of Code.
