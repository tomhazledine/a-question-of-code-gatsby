When you're pivoting to a career in tech, software bootcamps can seem very attractive. The idea that you can learn to code in three months, *and* have a guaranteed job at the end of the process sounds too good to be true. But is it? There are a lot of caveats and warning signs to beware of, but are bootcamps a valid option?

In this episode we discuss the specifics of coding bootcamps. Are they worth the cost (both in time and money)? What does Ed (a former teacher) think of the quality of teaching assistants at bootcamps? Does Tom think Income Share Agreements are a terrible idea? And what tricks do some disreputable bootcamps play to boost their "grads in employment" statistics? Find out all this and more in this week's awesome instalment of A Question of Code.
