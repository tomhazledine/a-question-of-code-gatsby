In a new venture for the aQoC team, we took our show on the road. Future Sync is a tech conference keeping you in-sync with the latest digital trends. We attended for a day of talks, interactive exhibitions alongside plenty of networking opportunities throughout the event.

We were able to speak to a whole range of people and get to the bottom of why people attend tech conferences, and what they get out of them. Find out all this and more in this week's pioneering instalment of A Question of Code.
