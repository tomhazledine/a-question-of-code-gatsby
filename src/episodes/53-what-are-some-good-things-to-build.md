We think that the best way to learn *is* by doing (it works for us, but your milage may vary). So when you are learning to code, what should you be doing? What are good things to build when you're just starting out? It's all well and good to say "Just Build Websites" *(©️ shoptalkshowdotcom)*, but *what* websites?

So what do we think you should build? Do we think different types of project are useful for complete beginners and those with a little bit more experience under their belt? What did we work on when we were first learning? And what do with think are the characteristics of a great self-driven project for learning? Find out all this and more in this week's gorgeous instalment of A Question of Code.
