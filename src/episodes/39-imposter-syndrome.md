There comes a point in every developer's career when they're afraid of being caught out. Afraid their colleagues will discover that they're a fraud. Afraid that everyone will notice that they don't really know how to do their job - they've just been pretending this entire time. This phenomenon happens all the time, and it's name is "Imposter Syndrome".

So what is imposter syndrome? Should you pay attention to it? Should you be on the look out for it in others? It sounds bad - and it really can be! Find out how to recognise imposter syndrome (and how to deal with it!) in this week's authentic instalment of A Question of Code.
