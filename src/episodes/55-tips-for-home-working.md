Lots of people are working from home now, and for many it's their first experience of being a remote worker. Ed is in this boat too - it's very new for him, having only worked from home for a single day at the time of recording. Tom, on the other hand, has worked remotely for many years (in some form or other).

So what obstacles has Ed already encountered? Which parts of WFH are worrying him most? And what tips and tricks does Tom have to share from his (and his more qualified and cleverer colleagues) experiences? Find out all this and more in this week's quarantined instalment of A Question of Code.
