summary: "How do you get your code onto the internet?"
---

At some point you're going to want to put the code you've written onto the internet. In the "bad old days" you should FTP your files onto a server and boom; you've got a working website. Easy peasy. But why don't we work like that any more? What are "build pipelines"? And what do terms like CI and CD stand for? And what do they actually _mean_? Who or what are Jenkins and Travis?

Do we need to know all these things? (Spoilers: yes, we do!) What are the benefits? Do they help with automation? With testing? With code backups?

The question on everybody's lips is this: why has deployment become so complicated? Find out all this and more in this week's fantastic instalment of A Question of Code.
