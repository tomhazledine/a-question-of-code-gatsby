For this weeks question Tom gives Ed lots of advice on where he should be 
applying to jobs. They discuss job boards and networking as well as many 
other places you can find jobs to apply to. Ed even gives Tom the 
opportunity to rant about recruiters (and Tom even manages to say some 
positive stuff about them!). If you’re even thinking about applying for a 
job in tech at the moment, make sure you listen to this weeks ‘A Question 
of Code’!
