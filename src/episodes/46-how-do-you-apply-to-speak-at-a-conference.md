AQoC takes on a new flavour this week with the addition of our first ever guest: the magnificent Tony Edwards, organiser of the Future Sync tech conference. Tony tells us all about the history of the conference, and graciously answers a lot of questions about the process of becoming a speaker.

What does a typical talk-application look like? How are submissions reviewed by the FS team? What makes a great talk topic? And why would you even want to give a talk in the first place? Find out all this and more in this week's blithesome instalment of A Question of Code.

As an extra special treat for our listeners, Tony has also created a discount code for tickets to Future Sync 2020. Use the code `AQUESTIONOFCODE` for 10% off your ticket [at checkout](https://futuresync.co.uk/bookyourticket.php).
