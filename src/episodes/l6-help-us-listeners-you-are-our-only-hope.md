We're hoping to do a "how long does it take to learn to code?" episode, but need more data points than just our own. With that in mind, we're inviting you to tell us your experiences. The best way to get in touch is through Twitter, where Tom has asked [this question](https://twitter.com/thomashazledine/status/1182921555820630016):

> *"Self-taught developers: how long did it take you to go from knowing you wanted to be a developer to actually starting work at your first dev job?"*
