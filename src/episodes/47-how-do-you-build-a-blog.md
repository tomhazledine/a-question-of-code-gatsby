We think that every developer should have a blog of some sort. But they shouldn't be hard to create. In this episode we dive into the mechanics of building and hosting your own blog. We run through ~all~ many of the options and answer the common questions. Why use a blogging tool? What is a Content Management System, and do you really need one? What do we think of the "Off the shelf" options? Are they all garbage, or do some have their uses?

What are Static Site Generators and why are they useful? When are they *not* the best option? And once you've built your site, where do you put it? Find out all this and more in this week's excellent instalment of A Question of Code.
